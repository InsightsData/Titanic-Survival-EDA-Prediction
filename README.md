# Titanic-Survival-EDA-Prediction

Python | Decision Tree
-

Overview
-
  - Used Python for the entire project
  - Investigated the Titanic dataset using Scipy, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn
  - Explored the relations between 'Survived' and other variables such as gender
  - Feature engineering was conducted
  - Decision Tree and Chi-squared test were introduced to predict heart disease and reached an accuracy of **^$#$%^&*%

Packages
