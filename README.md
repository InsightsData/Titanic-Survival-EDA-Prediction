# Titanic-Survival-EDA-Prediction

Python | Decision Tree
-

Overview
-
  - Used Python for the entire project
  - Investigated the Titanic dataset using Scipy, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn
  - Explored the relations between 'Survived' and other variables such as gender
  - Feature engineering was conducted
  - Decision Tree and Chi-squared test were introduced to predict heart disease and reached an accuracy of **^$#$%^&*%

Packages
-
  - Scipy, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Data source
-
  - Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

Incentives
-
  - To do Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Predict survival
  
Data cleaning
-
  - Check and compare columns in train and test datasets
  - Check data types and 
  - Change column names for better readability
  - Remove columns containing NAs of more than a half
  - Replace “88” in Fall with 0 for more accurate calculation result (“88” represents “None”: didn’t fall in the past 12 years)
  - Delete “77”/”99” in SleepTime & Fall (“77”/”99” represent answers of “Not sure”/”Refused(to answer)”)
  - Remove NAs in HeartDisease & SleepTime & Marital & Fall & BMI
  - Convert certain variables to factors and add labels
